## How It Works

1. Loads a cleaned dataset of Spotify songs with audio features.
2. Uses **KMeans clustering** to group songs by similar musical properties.
3. You enter a song name and how many similar songs you want.
4. The app finds your song’s cluster and recommends others from the same group.
